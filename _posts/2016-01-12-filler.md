      1. There are more various kinds of garbage to collect separately.
       - In actual development, there are three more categories than the current system.
         We have to consider how we separate more items.

      2. Because the existing garbage has the color, it recognizes the trash color instead of the color of the sticker.
      We should try to find a way to solve it.

      3. If multiple items arrive consecutively, we need to think about how to separate them more precisely.
