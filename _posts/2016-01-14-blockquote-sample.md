>" Disposable garbage collection is a big problem these days. Even if you separate trash, you will earn 10 billion won a year, and it will be a great help for your environment as well.However, as an example of the Seoul Night Market and the Bupyeong Market, disposable items are often used. It's always difficult to collect. In addition, 73% of waste is being disposed of in the same collection 
Local governments are struggling to get citizens to participate in separate segregation, but citizen participation is less than expected.We have been worried about reconsidering the way that people can conveniently use separate collection with robots or automated services.And as a solution to this, I have chosen the topic 'I will Separate' We made it with EV3-Mindstorm."
